# Flower-Classification-Model
## Description
Main goal of this model is to predict a name of flower-image also give the probability of the correctness of the output(name of the flower). This model was trained for
about 20 epoches and it give roughly 77% accuracy. you can also train the model again and adjust the paramters as you desired.

## Note
All the steps are explained thoroughly inside the jupyter-notebook. to get the gist of the model and how it works , you should read each notes inside the code carefully.

## Accuracy of the last four epochs
